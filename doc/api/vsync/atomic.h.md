_Rich interface of atomic operations and fences._ 

Atomics are implemented in custom assembly or compiler builtins. See [atomic/core.h](atomic/core.h.md) for implementation the documentation of the core interface. An additional dispatch layer allows for a more flexible use of the interface. Refer to atomic/dispatch.h for details.
